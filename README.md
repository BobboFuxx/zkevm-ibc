# ZK-EVM X Celestia Token Transfer Demo

> ⚠️ **Warning**
> This repository is a work in progress and under active development.

This repo exists to showcase transferring tokens to and from a Cosmos SDK chain (representing Celestia) and a ZK proveable EVM using the [IBC-Eureka solidity contracts](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/tree/main/src). The diagram below is meant to detail the components involved and, at a high level, how they interact with one another.

    ```shell
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

### Local development

```shell
# Start a local development environment by running
docker compose up --detach

# Deploy smart contracts on the EVM roll-up
make deploy-contracts
```

> TIP
> If you hit an error like: `[Revert] vm.envString: environment variable "E2E_FAUCET_ADDRESS" not found` then comment out the lines that use it from `./solidity-ibc-eureka/E2ETestDeploy.s.sol`
