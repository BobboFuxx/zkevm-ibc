> ⚠️ **Warning**
> This repository is a work in progress and under active development.

This repo exists to showcase transferring tokens to and from a Cosmos SDK chain (representing Celestia) and a ZK proveable EVM using the [IBC-Eureka solidity contracts](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/tree/main/src). The diagram below is meant to detail the components involved and, at a high level, how they interact with one another.
